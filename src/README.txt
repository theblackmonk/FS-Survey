The FS Survey form - A rough draft of an updated survey landing page
Project:
Includes 4 routes (for each presentation) with individual forms for each presenter.

Each Route is a unique link: localhost:3000/social currency, localhost:3000/cryptohacks

Currently the inputs are displayed below the submit button for testing purposes.

All inputs besides the optional name field must be filled before submit can be executed

Submit button passes entered data from child components to parent component App.js
While the data is not logged into any form after reaching the parent, it could be in the future. 


Future Upgrades:
Clean up and optimize code:
Condense form section into smaller more customizable components

The data from the form can be directly uploaded to a Google Sheet with
a google cloud api integration

Further visual improvements to match modern UI design

External links to websites can be included
